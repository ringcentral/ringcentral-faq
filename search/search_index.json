The only part that you should need to filter the response data for (based on the criteria you've provided) is \"result\" === \"Missed\".

Each record will have a \"result\" property, you will just need to filter out the results by the value \"Missed\" to get the records you want.</p> <p>Let me know if you'd like some example code for filtering these results.</p> <p>If I understood your response correctly there is no current way to add \"result\" as a query param while requesting a Call Log record.
