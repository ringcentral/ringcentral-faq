# How can I add new permissions to an app which is already in production?

For many years RingCentral had a policy that developers could not modify their applications once they were graduated to the production environment. 

In 2023, RingCentral removed this policy, making it possible for apps in production to be freely edited. In 2024, RingCentral went one step farther and removed the graduation process all together. 

Taken together this means that applications can now be freely edited and used in either sandbox or production. Please note however, that editing an application's assigned scopes may require you to deauthorize your current users in the process.
