# What does the error "your extension is not allowed to make outbound calls" mean?

**Question**

I am currently receiving the error message:

> Your extension is not allowed to make outbound calls with browser currently, please contact your account representative for an upgrade.

What do I do?

**Answer**

This error usually occurs with our WebRTC-based clients, most commonly [RingCentral Embeddable](https://ringcentral.github.io/ringcentral-embeddable/), a javascript embeddable web phone. 

If you are using sandbox environment, you can add free digital line(phone) to your extension via the [Admin Console](http://service.devtest.ringcentral.com/). You will need to login using the sandbox user credentials.
