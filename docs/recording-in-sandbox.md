# How do I enable call recording in the developer sandbox environment?

**Question**

I want to retrieve call logs and call records. For that i have given permission to Read Call Logs and Read Call Recordings.

But in Sandbox Environment there is no automatic call recording.

I want to create some call recording in sandbox environment to pass the graduation test.

Could any one help me in how to achieve that?

**Answer**

The sandbox account has on-demand call recording (*9 or the record button on the RingCentral app) but not automatic call recording.

You can learn more about [on-demand call recording](https://support.ringcentral.com/article/How-to-Initiate-On-Demand-Call-Recordings.html) from our knowledge base.

If you wish to create call recordings programmatically, a [sample app](https://github.com/anilkumarbp/Sample-Demo-to-Download-Call-Recordings) has been created which shows how to query and download the call log for recordings.
